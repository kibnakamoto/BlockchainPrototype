This is a merkle tree I'm creating for a future blockchain I will create, right now, I'm working on creating 256-bit and 512-bit unsigned integers. This Merkle Tree is for sha512 algorithm which I have implemented before. The Merkle Tree will be easy after creating the 256-bit and 512-bit integers. I will concatinate 4 128-bit integers as 1 in a tuple function
